# PS6-Web-App

Hello!

This [app](https://kylao.shinyapps.io/ps6-WebApp/) basically shows all data of threatened animals from IUCN in the recent years (2000 to 2021)..

## Tabs breakdown:
- The **first tab** just shows a small overview of the dataset.
- The **second tab** shows the average of different species, and the users are
able to choose which specie they want to see changes of threats from.. The colors 
can also be changed by the users.
- The **third tab** shows a data table of thrreatened species over different 
group of organisms.The user is able to select different group of organisms: 
Vertebrates, Invertebrates, Plants, Fungi & Protists.

## Here is the [link](https://kylao.shinyapps.io/ps6-WebApp/) to my shiny app. 

P.S. I worked on this PS for more than 8 hours on off lol.
